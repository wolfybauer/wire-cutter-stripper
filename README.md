# wire-cutter-stripper
As described. Based on design by Mr Innovative, adapted for OLED display and 4 button interface<br>

Also includes custom stepper motor library and library for OLED interface.<br>
I didn't like his servo mechanism so I switched it for a small linear actuator.<br>

BOM:<br>
2x Nema 17 stepper motor<br>
1x small linear actuator motor<br>
3x a4988 steppper drivers (ubiquitous "pololu" type)<br>
1x Arduino nano or similar<br>
4x NO momentary pushbuttons<br>
1x extruder to fit your motor (can be 3d printed, or I just used one from a 3d rinter I had laying around)<br>
1x wire cutter-stripper (like this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WJPRKIY/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_6?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)<br>
maybe a bearing, some ptfe tubing, and some other stuff.<br>
