Also includes custom stepper motor library and library for OLED interface.
I didn't like his servo mechanism so I switched it for a small linear actuator.

BOM:
2x Nema 17 stepper motor
1x small linear actuator motor
3x a4988 steppper drivers (ubiquitous "pololu" type)
1x Arduino nano or similar
4x NO momentary pushbuttons
1x extruder to fit your motor (can be 3d printed, or I just used one from a 3d rinter I had laying around)
1x wire cutter-stripper (like this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WJPRKIY/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_6?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1)
maybe a bearing, some ptfe tubing, and some other stuff.
